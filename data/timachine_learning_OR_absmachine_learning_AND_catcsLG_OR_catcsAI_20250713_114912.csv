2507.07965v1,Prospective Learning in Retrospect,"In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.LG,"cs.LG,stat.ML",Yuxin Bai; Cecelia Shuai; Ashwin De Silva; Siyu Yu; Pratik Chaudhari; Joshua T. Vogelstein,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07965v1
2507.07882v1,"Can AI-predicted complexes teach machine learning to compute drug
  binding affinity?","We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding
predictions without reference structures, enabling them to substitute for
experimental structures in MLSF training. Our study...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.LG,cs.LG,Wei-Tse Hsu; Savva Grevtsev; Thomas Douglas; Aniket Magarkar; Philip C. Biggin,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07882v1
2507.07857v1,"Searching for actual causes: Approximate algorithms with adjustable
  precision","Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users ...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.AI,cs.AI,Samuel Reyd; Ada Diaconescu; Jean-Louis Dessalles,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07857v1
2507.07668v1,"Learning Pole Structures of Hadronic States using Predictive Uncertainty
  Estimation","Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass th...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,hep-ph,"hep-ph,cs.AI,cs.LG,hep-ex",Felix Frohnert; Denny Lane B. Sombrillo; Evert van Nieuwenburg; Patrick Emonts,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07668v1
2507.07641v1,"Machine Learning-Assisted Surrogate Modeling with Multi-Objective
  Optimization and Decision-Making of a Steam Methane Reforming Reactor","This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,physics.chem-ph,"physics.chem-ph,cs.LG",Seyed Reza Nabavi; Zonglin Guo; Zhiyuan Wang,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07641v1
