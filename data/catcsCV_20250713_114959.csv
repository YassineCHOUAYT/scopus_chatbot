2507.08000v1,"Impact of Pretraining Word Co-occurrence on Compositional Generalization
  in Multimodal Models","CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual con...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.CV,"cs.CV,cs.LG",Helen Qu; Sang Michael Xie,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08000v1
2507.07999v1,"Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning: Evaluation and
  Methodology","Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human ""thinking with images"". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to ...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.CV,"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL",Haochen Wang; Xiangtai Li; Zilong Huang; Anran Wang; Jiacong Wang; Tao Zhang; Jiani Zheng; Sule Bai; Zijian Kang; Jiashi Feng; Zhuochen Wang; Zhaoxiang Zhang,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07999v1
2507.07998v1,PyVision: Agentic Vision with Dynamic Tooling,"LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy...",2025-07-10,2025-07-10,cs.CL,"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.CV",Shitian Zhao; Haoquan Zhang; Shaoheng Lin; Ming Li; Qilong Wu; Kaipeng Zhang; Chen Wei,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07998v1
