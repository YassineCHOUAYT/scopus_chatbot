2506.21552v1,Whole-Body Conditioned Egocentric Video Prediction,"We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose ca...",2025-06-26,2025-06-26,cs.CV,"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.MM,cs.RO",Yutong Bai; Danny Tran; Amir Bar; Yann LeCun; Trevor Darrell; Jitendra Malik,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21552v1
2506.09985v1,"V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction
  and Planning","A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of i...",2025-06-11,2025-06-11,cs.AI,"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG,cs.RO",Mido Assran; Adrien Bardes; David Fan; Quentin Garrido; Russell Howes;  Mojtaba;  Komeili; Matthew Muckley; Ammar Rizvi; Claire Roberts; Koustuv Sinha; Artem Zholus; Sergio Arnaud; Abha Gejji; Ada Martin; Francois Robert Hogan; Daniel Dugas; Piotr Bojanowski; Vasil Khalidov; Patrick Labatut; Francisco Massa; Marc Szafraniec; Kapil Krishnakumar; Yong Li; Xiaodong Ma; Sarath Chandar; Franziska Meier; Yann LeCun; Michael Rabbat; Nicolas Ballas,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09985v1
